# âœ… Analysis Results Added to .gitignore

## What Was Done

Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude analysis results from version control while preserving important documentation.

## Changes Made

### Before:
```gitignore
# Project specific
*.json
!config.yaml
logs/
*.log
```

### After:
```gitignore
# Project specific
*.json
!config.yaml
logs/
*.log

# Analysis results - generated files should not be tracked
analysis-results/*
!analysis-results/README.md
```

## What's Ignored vs Tracked

### âœ… **Ignored (Not Tracked):**
- `analysis-results/manifest.json`
- `analysis-results/flask_analysis.json`
- `analysis-results/spoon_knife/`
- `analysis-results/hello_world/`
- All other generated analysis files
- `tests/data/*.json` (already ignored by `*.json` rule)

### âœ… **Tracked (Kept in Git):**
- `analysis-results/README.md` (documentation)
- `config.yaml` (configuration template)
- All source code and prompts

## Verification

âœ… **Tested and confirmed:**
1. New analysis files are properly ignored
2. Existing documentation is still tracked  
3. No unwanted files appear in `git status`
4. `.gitignore` rules work as expected

## Benefits

1. **Clean Repository**: Generated analysis results won't clutter the repo
2. **Security**: Prevents accidental commit of potentially sensitive analysis data
3. **Documentation Preserved**: Important README files are still tracked
4. **Flexible**: Easy to add specific files if needed using `!filename` syntax

Your analysis results are now properly excluded from version control! ðŸŽ‰
